<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The purpose of this project was to create a Tic Tac Toe game to practice implementing factory functions and the module pattern within JavaScript. The design of the user interface, storage, and security aspects were not within the scope of this project.

The functionality of the project is what one would expect when playing tic-tac-toe. Players begin by entering their name and the marker they would like to use. Thereafter, the game begin until either a tie game occurs or one of the players accomplishes a three-in-a-row pattern. The players can either play again or choose to restart and change names and markers.
